# out-of-distribution-model-behaviour

---

Just visualizing for a couple of non-linear models how the predictions develop, when confronted with sample data out of the trained distribution. The modeling methods are:

- Support Vector Regression
- Random Forrest
- Gradient Booster
- Simple Feed Forward  Network
- Regression Tree
- Gaussean Process

The data is some arbitrary trigonometric surface in 3d space.
